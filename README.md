## WebpackReactStarterKit

> A starting point for building web applications with Webpack and React

#### Prerequisites (for everyone)

The full starter kit requires the following major dependencies:

- Node.js, used to run JavaScript tools from the command line.
- npm, the node package manager, installed with Node.js and used to install Node.js packages.

**To install dependencies:**

1)  Check your Node.js version.

```sh
node --version
```

The version should be at or above 0.12.x.

2)  If you don't have Node.js installed, or you have a lower version, go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) and click on the big green Install button.

4)  Install the starter kit's local `npm`  dependencies.

```sh
cd WebpackReactStarterKit && npm install
```

#### Serve / watch

```sh
npm start
```

#### Build & Vulcanize

```sh
gulp build
```

Build and optimize the current project, ready for deployment. This includes linting as well as vulcanization, image, script, stylesheet and HTML optimization and minification.
